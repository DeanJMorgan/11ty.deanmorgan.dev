# About Me

Hi there, I'm Dean. I'm a Frontend Web Developer from Darwen, UK. I specialise in building highly optimsed websites that deliver fast and reliable experiences to their users.

I've been building websites in one form or another since 1998 and during that time I've worked many different roles for many different companies. I am currently working as a Frontend Developer for [Pinpoint Designs](https://www.pinpointdesigns.co.uk/), a specialist Magento 2 Agency based in Leeds.

I also produce music and have done so for over 20 years. For many years (throughout most of my 20s) I did this as a career, working fulltime as Producer/DJ. During that time I was lucky enough to work with some of the biggest brands in dance music and was featured on various different releases around the world. This is not a site about my music career, but I'm sure I'll dedicate a page too it at some point in the future as I am proud of the things I achieved.

## Skills I've acquired

# About This Site

This site is built using 11ty (eleventy), an open source static site generator and is hosted on GitHub pages. The build process includes support for Sass and Javascript compilation and there is also support for tests powered by Mocha.

Throughout the development of this website, I will be documenting the development and techniques used to build this site, which will be available to read as part of a case study series.

# Projects I am working on

The following are some of the projects I am currently working on in my personal time. Most of the projects will be heavily featured in my the articles on this site.

## This site

This site is a project in it's own right. Over the years I've used a variety of different static site generators previously, I've even built my own which served me really well and was used to prototype a handful of sites which have since gone to production. However, this site is built using 11ty as I'd been watching the project for some time, but never had a real oppurtunity to build anything with it.

### Future plans for this site

Going forwards, my plan for this site is to integrate a custom CSS framework (based on InuitCSS), find a method of compiling JavaScript that is optimised for performance (This could be challenging, JavaScript is my weakest strength), build out the design into something more 'pretty', and to start creating content for readers other than myself. Sounds simple, the biggest challenge I face with it is time. *NOTE: This is so far proving true*

## Magento 2 Frontend Performance

As a frontend developer, with a background in SEO, I have a strong passion for frontend performance. The aim of this project is to find areas of Magento 2 where the frontend performance can be improved. The direction of this project is very open-ended and will be somewhat dependant on the results of the benchmark testing that is done. It could end up as a module, it may be implemented into the theme I am developing, or it may just be an article that I release based on my findings. Whatever form it takes, I'm sure there will be more dicussion around it on this site as time progresses.

## Magento 2 BEM Theme (BEMagento)

The basic aim of this project is to create a brand new Magneto 2 theme from scratch which fully incorporates the use of the BEM methodology. In reality, the true aim is to build a lightweight, high-performance Magento 2 theme that has been optimised for page-load speed, seo and accessibility. It should also be built to be as developer friendly as possible. Each step of the development process should be catered for, with the initial setup, workflow, testing and deployment all being well documented.

## Magento 2 Boilerplate

A project that serves as a starting point for other projects. It can be used to spin up brand new sites with a clean Magento 2 install, but with some additiona DX goodies such as scss compilation from site root (Based on Snowdog Frontools). This is just a personal piece so that I can easily set up new projects 'my way' but if it becomes useful to anyone else then that's great.

## Tasty

Originally this was going to be a CSS framework. I'd already built a prototype version which I'd been using for some time, and I was going to make a few improvements, rebrand it and release it as an open-source project. I've had some great ideas for this project that will take it beyond being a CSS framework, into something much more. I am also going to use this project to learn more about React development *Note: There is a bit of a clue in that statement as to the direction this project may be going*
